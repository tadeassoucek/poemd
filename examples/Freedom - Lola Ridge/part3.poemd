Let men be free!
Hate is the price
Of servitude, paid covertly; and vice
But the unclean recoil of tortured flesh
Whipped through the centuries within a mesh
Spun out of priestly art.
Oh men, arise, be free!---Who breaks one bar
Of tyranny in this so bitter star
Has cleansed its bitterness in part.
